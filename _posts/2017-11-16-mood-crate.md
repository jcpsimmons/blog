## Brainstorm Stage II: The Mood Crate


Creating a "Mood Crate" can be an extremely helpful activity early on in the compositional process. I originally heard of the technique in an interview with composer David Whitacre. When Whitacre was asked what music he listens to while working on a piece, he replied that he listened to choral music when working on intrumental music, and instrumental music when working on choral music. The cross-pollination is obvious in his music, his band pieces are evocative of lush vocal sounds, and his choral music is written as if the voice is a mechanically refined instrument.

The term Mood Crate is my adaptation of the "Mood Wall" technique in visual design fields. A Mood Crate is your auditory corkboard that can help to be your guiding star along the journey of writing a piece of music.

To create a Mood Crate, first you need to brainstorm in more general terms about the piece. I outline this briefly in my previous post.

1. After brainstorming, take a look at your paper. If you wrote down any pieces, musicians, albums, etc., circle them. Jot those down on a separate piece of paper.

2. Look again at your brainstorm paper. Are there any musical associations you can make with anything else on the page? For example, if you wrote "Star Wars" you might add John Williams to your Mood Crate. If John Williams doesn't jibe with what you're trying to do, then examine what you like about Star Wars in the abstract. If you enjoy the sound design of the film, you might do a quick Google search to find out some of the music technology used to make the sounds, and then search for musicians that use this technology. Think outside of the box on this step, but let your gut be the gatekeeper. I know so many professionals in academic music that have guilty pleasures that they are terrified to let come through in their music. **Don't be guilty about your pleasures, especially if it's going to help you create a great piece of music.**

3. Make the list about 20-30 pieces long.

4. Remove the weakest/most irrelevant items from this list until you've whittled down to the 10 strongest/most relevant pieces.

5. Get these pieces into some kind of extremely convenient, playlist-based, ad-free playback medium. I strongly suggest using a service such as Spotify Premium (just pay the fucking fee and support the artists a little bit), Apple Music, or whatever the current streaming service-du-jour is. What you don't want is a format that is going to ruin your immersion with ads, or make you physically switch media like CDs.

6. After compiling your playlist, write the names of all of the songs on a new piece of paper. Listen to each piece. As you're listening, jot down at least 3 things, but not more than 5, that you can "mine" from each piece.

7. Read over the notes you've taken. Notice similar themes. In my notes for example, I have "singable melody", and "cheesy theme". I'm getting at roughly the same thing with these two statements - both of those songs have a melody that is an ear-worm.

8. Listen to your playlist whenever you can, on loop. Don't listen on shuffle, you want all songs to have even representation. Walking to work? Listen to your Mood Crate. On the bus? Listen to your Mood Crate. Boss complaining at you? Listen to your Mood Crate. You get the idea.

Going through this process allows you to hear your nascent piece in other pieces, in sections. It avoids the "blank page" phenomenon because you are taking in material that allows you to react to it - I like this, I don't like that. Keep listening to your Mood Crate, and reading over your notes. Take some down time. The ideas will begin to grow naturally from this starter over the next day or two.
