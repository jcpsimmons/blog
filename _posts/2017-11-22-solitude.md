### 48 days remaining

I hit rock bottom in my work-life balance when I was a sophomore in undergrad. At that point I was a flute performance major. I was nerdy and awkward. I was struggling to make friends, and struggling harder to be a great flutist. I was practicing about 5 hours a day (which is a very conservative amount compared to most performers by the way). A few friends invited me to a party on Halloween night. I of course turned down the invitation and spent the night in a practice room working on Bozza. I remember the intense feeling of loneliness I had that night staring out the window of the practice room. The midwest sun set early. I could see nobody outside the window. To this day, I wonder if that night is the reason I feel an unexplainable sadness in Fall.

The arts emerge out of human experience. If it is the other way around, the work is sterile and lifeless. If you're around academic musicians you likely know a number of folks that fall into this category (certainly not all or even most, but a few). These performers (again, the "practice-first" minority) are the robotic automotons that merely see notes on a page to be played with perfect accuracy. They are the 2nd chair symphony sloggers. They are replaceable with a computer. This is most painfully obvious when you listen to young musicians attempt to play Beethoven's late quartets.

Some context - Beethoven did not have an easy life. He is at least partially responsible for the tourtured artist archetype that we still worship today. He famously suffered from hearing loss, as well as various illnesses that left him occasionally bedridden for lengths of time. At one point he even [considered suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiligenstadt_Testament). Beethoven wrote his late quartets in 1826. He was violently ill while writing these works. He sensed the end was near, and wrote at a frantic pace - a man leaving his last marks on the earth. His soul remaining in his body despite it being past closing time, only out of some universal responsibility to mankind to record the experience in musical notation so that it might be passed down and understood by others.

Assume you have a string quartet made up of performers in their early-20s. What do these performers know about having the body fail, but the spirit persist? What do they know of death and dying? Of honor and duty? Have they faced challenges so insurmountable that they've considered the alternative? There are always exceptions, and our theoretical string quartet may have members that have had some of these experiences. Isn't it a piece that would be better suited to older performers though? Technical ability is a small part of the picture.

Music school doesn't teach you how to be an artist. This isn't because it's not teachable, but becasue it's messy, it doesn't fit into the beauracracy. Sometimes it's politcally incorrect, often times it's "inappropriate". It deals intensely with the messy stuff of life, because that's the ground that the art grows out of.

## Take breaks, go outside, interact with humans.

This post is a long anecdote which can be distilled into the following: don't spend your life in a practice room. Even if it makes you technically proficient, it won't make you an artist if you have no life experience to go with it.

Today Thanksgiving Break begins. I'll still blog, I'll still improvise. What I won't do is work on my loadbang piece in any kind of organized way. That can wait until next Monday when I'm back on the clock. It's time to read, go to the beach, spend time with my girlfriend and her family, spend time with my close friends, and hang out with my family.
