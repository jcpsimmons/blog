## My First Time Writing Notated Music in Two Years
### 54 days remaining

I don't really write "dots on paper" music anymore. I went way down the synthesizer/electronic music rabbit hole a couple of years ago and haven't really looked back. Creating with electronics is more similar to my early encounters with music. When I played guitar as a child I didn't even know what a chord was, I just played by ear. In addition to this direct connection with the material, electronic music gives instant feedback. When I used to write for ensembles, I would have to hold onto my material for months before hearing it played -- and usually when it was played it wasn't very good. Sometimes this was the ensemble's fault, but usually it was my fault. The world doesn't move on a kind of time scale that's conducive to that kind of slow learning, i.e. make a mistake, and don't hear the mistake until 3 months later at the premiere.

I threw my hat in the ring to write for highly-esteemed "new music chamber group" **loadbang**. One does not turn down the opportunity to write for an ensemble of loadbang's caliber. I'm not letting my fear of notating this piece stop me from taking advantage of the opportunity.

What is the compositional process in 2017? In my case it's not going to involve serialism, combinatorial hexachords, or any other ridiculous 1970s compositional buzzwords. Instead my plan is to start off with what I am good at: playing a synthesizer, making loops, and using Ableton Live. After I have a good amount of material, I'll start refining and making a more definite plan.

This blog is a peek inside of that creative process. I'll write about any tips, wisdom, and pitfalls I have along the way so you can benefit from my experience. In addition, I'll have a comments section below each post so you can tell me your opinions on what I'm working on, and share your experience as well.

Before **all** of that though, I have to brainstorm. I always start in a notebook, usually a Moleskine, and using a G2 Pen (the .07mm variety -- I find that the .05mm forces the hand to work too hard against the page, and the 1.0mm is too imprecise). Typically I start by riffing on the concept of "Shit I like right now". This will usually kick off a few trains of thought. The one that I'll start leveraging early is musical inspiration. I'll figure out what kind of music is on my "Mood Board" for the piece and create a Spotify playlist that I will listen to obsessively and constantly during the beginning of the process.

**Possible Listening**

- Blade Runner Soundtrack (Vangelis original, and sequel)
- Music for 18 Musicians by Steve Reich
- Shri Camel - Terry Riley
- Deadmau5 (songs with arpeggios specifically)
- Gessefalstein
- Daft Punk
- Kavinsky

Here's a peek at my brainstorming process:
