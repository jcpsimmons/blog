### 50 days remaining

I have a lot of ideas floating around in my head. It's only 50 days out so it's time to make decisions on which ones live and which ones don't make the cut. I've decided to dive right in and make a "form graph". This is an exercise I picked up from composer [Elainie Lillios](http://elillios.com/). Making a form graph has developed into sort of a superstitious ritual for me when I begin work on a piece. Apart from this importance, it also has directly identifiable benefits to the creative process. First let me back up and explain what a form graph is.

## What is a form graph?

A one page graphical representation of the piece of music you intend to write. It can be as detailed or as abstract as you wish to make it, although after experimenting with both ends of the spectrum, you'll find a "sweet spot" resolution. An abstract form graph might look like a Jackson Pollock painting. This kind of graph may be indicative of the general mood or feeling that the piece portrays. A more detailed form graph may simply be a chart of y-axis intensity over x-axis time. Anything goes.

## Tools

For this exercise I prefer to use a letter sized piece of white paper folded lengthwise. For a writing implement I like to use a Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen.

Any writing implement can be used for this exercise. I have seen form graphs made with crayons, markers, etc. I shy away from using colors other than black and white because I enjoy the clean look of the completed form graph. This is a personal preference. It is however very important to **decide on the paper size before beginning**. Having a fixed paper size will provide a constraint for the exercise. Contraints demand creativity.

## Process

1. Set out paper and drawing implement(s).
2. Imagine the piece in your mind's ear. How long is it? Are there multiple sections or is it one long section? Where does it peak? Where is it fragile?
3. Draw the piece without erasing or editing. Don't question yourself while creating.
4. Keep the graph with you at all times while writing the piece. It is your map.

I've posted my graph below for the loadbang piece I am working on. If you make your own graph post it in the comments, or email me at [jcpsimmons@gmail.com](mailto:jcpsimmons@gmail.com) I'll post submitted graphs on the blog next week.
