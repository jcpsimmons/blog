I'm writing this while sitting in a coffee shop in Las Vegas. This is the first time I've experienced travel while feeling how I imagine most people feel while travelling. I don't feel like I'm caught in a dream, my heart isn't racing, I slept reasonably well last night, I'm able to enjoy experiences. This is actually a first for me. **Those of you that know me probably don't know that I've been dealing with massive amounts of anxiety for a long time** - mostly in the form of [agoraphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoraphobia). Most commonly agoraphobia is understood as a fear of large groups of people. While large groups of people do sometimes increase my anxiety, my biggest struggle has been with an indistinct, hard to pin down fear of travelling. I've only recently started to open up about these experiences. As I've talked to close friends about it, I've found that most people have some kind of fear they're dealing with - some with agoraphobia, others with social anxiety, etc. It's my hope that by writing this and sharing my story, I'm able to give some kind of a way out of that fear to someone out there reading this. I also hope that this is a small contribution towards removing the stigma around anxiety disorders. True power isn't the absense of fear. **True power is being able to openly and honestly confront one's own fears.**

I've been in and out of therapy for many years. Some of it was helpful but most of it wasn't. I don't blame the therapists, I think anxiety patients are kind of an edge-case for many of them. About a year ago, a therapist floated the idea that maybe I have agoraphobia. I never thought this to be the case, because as I mentioned, huge groups of people raise my anxiety but don't petrify me. This particular therapist has me take a diagnostic for agoraphobia, and sure enough my score was top of the class. After taking the issue directly to the oracle (i.e. Wikipedia), I essentially read a biography about my fears. A few excerpts that particularly spoke to me:

- ...sufferers become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control.
- Triggers for this anxiety may include traveling (even short distances).
- ...the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public.
- Agoraphobics may suffer from temporary separation anxiety disorder...


# A Brief History


After being able to put a name on something I'd been feeling for so long, I was finally able to discuss it, and come up with a plan for overcoming it, or at least coping with it.
