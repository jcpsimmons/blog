I'm writing this while sitting in a coffee shop in Las Vegas. This is the first time I've experienced travel while feeling how I imagine most people feel while travelling. I don't feel like I'm caught in a dream, my heart isn't racing, I slept reasonably well last night, I'm able to enjoy experiences. This is actually a first for me. **Those of you that know me probably don't know that I've been dealing with massive amounts of anxiety for a long time** - mostly in the form of [agoraphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoraphobia). Most commonly agoraphobia is understood as a fear of large groups of people. While large groups of people do sometimes increase my anxiety, my biggest struggle has been with an indistinct, hard to pin down fear of travelling. I've only recently started to open up about these experiences. As I've talked to close friends about it, I've found that most people have some kind of fear they're dealing with - some with agoraphobia, others with social anxiety, etc. It's my hope that by writing this and sharing my story, I'm able to give some kind of a way out of that fear to someone out there reading this. I also hope that this is a small contribution towards removing the stigma around anxiety disorders. True power isn't the absense of fear. **True power is being able to openly and honestly confront one's own fears.**


# You Can't Fight an Enemy You Can't See


I've been in and out of therapy for many years. Some of it was helpful but most of it wasn't. I don't blame the therapists, I think anxiety patients are kind of an edge-case for many of them. About a year ago, a therapist floated the idea that maybe I have agoraphobia. I never thought this to be the case, because as I mentioned, huge groups of people raise my anxiety but don't petrify me. This particular therapist had me take a diagnostic for agoraphobia, and sure enough my score was top of the class. After taking the issue directly to the oracle (i.e. Wikipedia), I essentially read a biography about my fears. A few excerpts that particularly spoke to me:

- ...sufferers become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control.
- Triggers for this anxiety may include traveling (even short distances).
- ...the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public.
- Agoraphobics may suffer from temporary separation anxiety disorder...


# A Brief History


After being able to put a name on something I'd been feeling for so long, I was finally able to discuss it, and come up with a plan for overcoming it, or at least coping with it.

Funnily enough when I talked about it with family and close friends (most extremely supportive, some very judgemental), even the most supportive ones seemed confused. This wasn't due to a lack of support, but because I hid it so damn well. While working on my Master's degree I would travel to at least 2 conferences every semester - some of these being substantial trips, one was even from Ohio to Greece. My dirty secret from this whole time period: **I was fucking terrified most of the time on these trips**. I wouldn't sleep or eat well, and felt like I was willfully trying to not panic for large portions of these trips.

Despite the general shittiness of not being able to fully enjoy a hike up the Parthenon, or my hard earned smørrebrød and espresso in a cozy Stockholm cafe, I was coping, albeit shittily as I would learn later.

Flying was the worst for me. My fear of flying was different than a lot of other peoples' fear of flying. I didn't give a fuck about being very high above the ground. I had no fears of the plane crashing. What terrified me was not being able to leave the plane at will for the duration of the flight. My coping mechanism around 2013-2015 was to boot up my laptop and start making music as such a frantic pace that I wouldn't realize I was on a plane. **Great for making music, bad coping mechanism!** I should mention that I did write one of my favorite pieces of music of ALL TIME on a plane, it's appropriately titled [WroteThisWhile30000FtInTheAir](https://soundcloud.com/simsies/wrotethiswhile30000ftintheair) and the track's associated photo is Copenhagen out of the plane window.

As with many of life's other afflictions, I needed to hit rock bottom before authentic change could happen. This happened around late 2015. I was accepted to a university in Southern California to work on my funded PhD, my lifetime dream realized. Southern California is 36 hours away by car from my hometown (and roughly the same area I completed my Master's degree). The trip out to California is enough material for another huge post so I'll spare the details here. What I will say though is I remember waking up every morning to do 5-8 hours of driving, the pangs of terror got more and more intense with every passing mile. Further and further I drove outside of my comfort zone, my haven where no panic could touch me.

I have to strike some details from this part of the story, maybe including them after I'm more established in my career path, but for now I can say that much complexity was added to the situation, complexity that left me homeless. Luckily I was able to secure housing quickly that fit within my price range. I owe this miracle to a good friend who let me stay at his apartment for far less rent than it was worth. I don't want to mention him by name, but if he's reading this, he knows I'm talking about him. Much of my early success in California is largely due to his mentorship.

Oddly enough, hitting my "rock bottom" wasn't as terrible as I pictured it. California started to feel a bit more like home. I was surviving, but I wasn't thriving. It would be another year before I got an official diagnosis as an agoraphobe, which is when the real healing would begin.


# Treatment


After putting a name on this thing I was feeling. I was referred to a therapist who specialized in "exposure therapy". Briefly put exposure therapy is where the patient practices doing what they are afraid of in metered doses until they are desensitized to it. Since my case is a bit abstract it may be a bit easier to give an example with someone who is afraid of something more tangible such as riding in an elevator.

The first step for our elevator-fearing friend would be to get him to take the smallest step towards riding in the elevator. This step may be as small as looking at the elevator from 10 feet away (these steps need to be SPECIFIC, fear will make everything subjective, so you need a yardstick that you can hold yourself to). So for step one, our friend would stand 10 feet away from the elevator while looking at it. If they feel intense fear during this step, they would take a break, and keep repeating this step until the fear is at a manageable or even non existent level. The next step would be to stand 5 feet away. More steps in this progression could be standing halfway in the elevator, standing in the elevator with doors open, standing in the elevator with doors closed, riding the elevator 1 floor, then 2 floors, etc. with each step repeated until the fear dissapates.


With the help of the therapist, I put together a twofold plan: an exposure hierarchy for panic attack symptoms, and an exposure hierarchy for travel.


## Panic Exposure


Panic exposure consisted of timed exercises that made me feel the symptoms of a panic attack. For me the most prevalent feeling was of feeling "unreal". Kind of that feeling you get when you haven't slept in a few days. In order to practice this I would stare into my eyes in a mirror for various times using a stopwatch (starting at about 10 seconds and gradually expanding). Now if I have this sensation, I don't give a fuck about it because I've practiced it...a lot... I know I can hang, and that nothing bad is gonna happen.

Other exercises were breathing through a coffee straw (to produce dissociation and lightheadedness), holding my breath (I got up to a bit over a minute!!), hyperventillating, and being spun in an office chair.

Most of these exercises gave me really similar sensations to those that I feel when having a panic attack. I've had some limited symptom attacks since practicing these, and they're not very scary anymore because I know that the various sensations an attack produces feel shitty, but are harmless.


## Travel Exposure


Travel exposure was a bit more difficult to practice... The therapist was able to parse out my flying thing - that the trapped feeling was what was scary to me. I couldn't really afford to take a flight every week so the therapist came up with two awesome exercises for me: having a friend lock me in the trunk, and having a friend lock me in a small room. Once building up in these two areas, I would take a flight as my "graduation project".

So many people were judgemental about the trunk exercise. Fuck them because it was the **most effective part of my therapy.** My current girlfriend agreed to time the exercises and operate the trunk lock. I'm extremely grateful, it was a huge trust building and bonding experience, and I think a lot of partners would have been weirded out or judgemental. She was always supportive and enthusiastic, in hindsight maybe she was just happy to shut me up for a bit too.

Day 1 of the trunk exercise, I started with a whopping 5 seconds. This was enough to get me to the threshold of a panic attack. I got out of the trunk for a bit, stabilized, then did it again, and again, and again, until I felt no fear. Again at 10 seconds. Fear, less fear, less fear, fearless. Over the course of weeks I worked up to longer stretches of time in the small room and trunk.

Towards the end of the therapy, I took a flight to San Francisco. I was a bit nervous, but the fear wasn't overwhelming and I mostly felt calm during the vacation. Most importantly, I faced the flight head on. I didn't try to look away. I didn't work on music. It was a huge step.

Just yesterday I flew to Las Vegas (where I'm writing this). I listened to a podcast, and looked out the window the whole time. I was able to enjoy seeing the cities, mountains and deserts drift by. I actually fucking enjoyed it. It was like watching a movie but better.

Now I'm in Las Vegas and I'm calm. I'm enjoying the trip. I don't feel very different than when I'm at home. It's just not very scary.


# Post-Mortem


I was really hesitant to start doing exposure therapy. Being locked in the trunk sounded totally ridiculous, but then I did it for 5 seconds and was humbled. If you're reading this and you think exposure therapy would help you, my advice is to just **start with the smallest increment you think you can handle without dying and just do it**. It sounds ridiculous. Your anxiety-brain will try to weasel its way out of the situation by any means necessary. You will have to face the weakest, most excuse-making parts of yourself and become honest. If you start running, you're going to just keep running, the fear will never let up that way, it'll always be a few steps behind. I think a lot of people live their whole lives that way to a greater or lesser extent - not all fears are cripping on a day to day basis, some cripple the spirit gradually, imperceptibly, over decades. That process goes like this: you're born with a dream for your life, keep making comprimises out of fear and end up working a job that doesn't fulfill you, with no designs on leaving, and then you take out this existential anger in clumsy ways - like using a position of power to control people.

Fighting the anxiety is also a pretty bad choice (take it from someone that tried for a long time). The typically the macho man, I'm bigger than my problems approach (again, I've been there). You think "FUCK THIS ANXIETY" and stuff it way down. That doesn't eliminate it. Sometimes it sublimates it - you end up ripping a coat hanger out of the wall during an argument - but it's still there, it just put on a new outfit. It can also be transmuted to productivity for a little bit. I know a colleague who swears by this technique isn't aware that he's doing it!

You have to greet the anxiety. Let it be in you. Let yourself panic. Fuck it. You've practiced panicing through exposure therapy. You feel like shit and then eventually you don't. The storm always passes eventually, just stand in the rain, play in the puddles.

For flights, I usually wear sweatpants and a tee shirt to maximize comfort. This past flight I wore a button-down shirt and blazer. Getting a chance to interact with the anxiety is like talking to an old friend who is kind of a prankster. I see my old friend less and less these days. I respect him, I want to dress well when I greet him, but I don't take him at his word anymore. Sometimes he says, "You're going to loose your fucking mind!". Now I just chuckle and pat him on the shoulder. He's helped me write so much music, he encouraged me to start working out, he made me face down the ugliest, most dishonest parts of my self, but he can fib with the best of em.

*Thanks to Anthony, Karan, Victoria, and George. Without your help I'd probably be at home right now instead of Vegas.*
