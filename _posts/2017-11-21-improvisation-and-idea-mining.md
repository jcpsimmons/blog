It's astounding to me that there are musicians that *don't* improvise. Improvisation is the fastest idea generation method. I can't think of any musician playing in any kind of style that wouldn't benefit greatly from adding a bit of daily improvisation into their routine.

I think that the reason that most people avoid improvising is because they are scared of it, or "don't know how". This is a bit alien to me because I began my musical journey by improvising, long before I learned how to read notation. If you fall into the "I don't know how" category - and I put this in quotes because everybody *knows* how, when they say this, what they actually mean is "I'm scared that it will be embarassing or that I won't instantly be good at it" - I plan on writing a whole series of posts on the topic.

Today I'm working on listening to a lot of my own improvisations. I've been live streaming my improv sessions on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/simsiesmusic/) lately. It's helpful for me to have an audience while improvising - it creates a bit of underlying tension for me - a need to fill the silence with something, anything.

I save these videos for later perusal. The great thing about recording improvisations, is that you can take a snippet that has promise but maybe came out kinda half-baked, and refine it until it's something really useable.

I want the opening section of my loadbang piece to be improvisatory sounding - for inspirationg I'm using the opening bassoon solo from *The Rite of Spring*. The best way to get something improvisatory sounding is to.....dictate something improvised.
