I didn't post at all next week - I take all holidays and weekends off with rare exception. One of the important lessons I've learned from weightlifting is that no muscle growth takes place during a workout - it takes place while you're recovering, i.e. *not* working out. Creative work operates on the same principle - **you're not growing while creating, you're growing while you're not creating.** Over the break I spent time with friends and family.

During the break I received a bunch of messages from readers asking me to elaborate on the physical tools I use while creating (most of which I've hinted at already in previous posts). Below is a list of tools that I arrived at after years of restlessly trying different setups. Here are a few of my favorite tools for composing:

## A soft-cover Moleskine notebook, dotted.

I've been using Moleskines for almost 10 years now. The Moleskine notebook is the most reliable tool in my creativity arsenal. The journals are nice and sturdy. I love the battered, war-torn look they get further into their lifespan. The paper is a light cream color and extremely pleasant to write on. I feel as though the tactile quality of the paper demands that it be filled with wild ideas. An included tassle helps you find the most recent page you were working on quickly and efficiently. One of the most useful features is an accordian pocket in the back of the book for storing any interesting bits you may come across, love notes, business cards, or (my favorite) [found paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundPaper/). The archival quality of the notebooks are fantastic also - I have filled journals dating back many years that are still in mint condition, unfortunately many of the ideas inside didn't age as well as the notebooks... Moleskines come in a number of different layouts - I used to be a purist and prefer the blank white page. Lately I've gotten into [Bullet Journaling](http://bulletjournal.com/) and have begun to use the dotted variety.

## Pilot G2 gel pens in varying point sizes.

Another long-time standby. The G2s pair niceley with a Moleskine notebook. The gel ink glides across the page and reaches a good compromise between ease-of-stroke and drying time. What's interesting about my relationship with these pens is how my day-to-day life has influenced my proclivity for various point sizes. During times of my life when I have been more of a micromanager, I preferred the miniscule 0.5mm variety. Crisp clear lines and tiny writing. No margin for error or smeared ink. During more creative outpourings I have preferred the 1.0mm variety, a.k.a. the "thicc boi". The 1.0mm slops all over the page and makes woderful ink smears making things vaguely readable, and aesthetically pleasing. Lately I've taken a middle ground here and stuck with the best of both worlds 0.7mm offering. N.B. these pens are awesome for thumb spinning - the **marginally** less cringey version of the fidget spinner. ![Pen Spin](https://simsi.es/blog/public/penflip.gif)

## A reasonable fountain pen.

Sometimes you just want to feel like a romantic era composer, and for that task a ballpoint pen simply will not do. I briefly and embarassingly experimented with quill and inkwell for a while but found the setup to be extremely inconvenient, and drew exasperated stares from teachers and fellow students when bringing the setup to my classes and meetings. A great compromise is a cartridge fountain pen. Cartridge fountain pens use a nib, but the ink is stored in the body of the pen, eliminating the need for an elaborate and spill-prone setup. Fountain pens can get extremely expensive, but a great starter option is the Pilot Metropolitan. It serves as a "daily writer" pen for me.

## Lines to dot(e) over.

When I'm done pissing around in brainstorm land about this piece for loadbang I'll need to write some notes down. I know a lot of composers who jump right into writing in Sibelius or Finale, but what decisions are they allowing the software to make for them I wonder? The most prophetic composition teacher I ever studied with insisted that I do all of my scores in ink, as in ink and paper, by hand. I'll never be a professional copyist, but having the ability to quickly sketch out notes is an invaluable tool in the composer's arsenal. It also makes everything about equally difficult to notate so you aren't forced into conceptual boxes by softare. Again spring for some good paper here. Don't go writing on some shitty substitute like Carta or Hal Leonard. You're writing a piece of notated music Goddamnit! Pay the extra money and get a big-ass (tabloid sized) notebook of Archives paper.

## Bonus: go juice.

I'm going to write a full post about coffee here at some point. For brevity and to fit this post though I will only mention one bit of coffee paraphenelia - and that is, your favorite mug. Recently I have been phasing out my favorite and lucky mug of 10 years because the ceramic has actually worn away on the inside to such a degree that I'm not sure it's safe to drink out of anymore. The mug is out of production so I've been exploring alternatives. One alternative design I've been enjoying recently is a Coleman camp mug. It's got a nice tinny feeling to it and I love how easily it cleans up.
