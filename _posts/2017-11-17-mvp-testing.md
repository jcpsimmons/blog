Test your small ideas in the sloppiest way possible.

I was taking a nap yesterday, and in the fog between waking and sleeping I heard a cool idea.

What if I write dyads (two note harmonies) for the trumpet and trombone, drench those in reverb (like the sawtooth synth in the Blade Runner pieces in my Mood Crate), and then sidechain bass clarinet slap tonguing against it?

This technique integrates a bunch of the different pieces in my Mood Crate. I was half-asleep when I thought of it, so today I set out to test it. Testing in a sloppy manner is generally good. Sometimes creatives tend to get really fussy and have an unreasonably high standard for their work even in the creation phase. Most of those creatives dont actually create much though. I prefer to get my hands dirty. To test my sidechain idea I made the simplest possible simulation in Ableton.

1. I grabbed a YouTube video that had slap tonguing samples in it and isolated a few of those pitches as one-shots in Ableton's simpler.
2. I made two MIDI tracks with Ableton's Operator -- the patch was configured to just use a gated sawtooth tone (close enough for brass...)
3. I put a compressor on the trumpet/trombone tracks and sidechained it to the slap tongue instrument

I think it sounds pretty good. I am definitely going to use the technique in the piece.
