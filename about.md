## I'm a creative.

Until now I haven't shared my creative process. Lately I've been having more people ask "how" I'm making instead of "what" I've made. In an attempt to answer this question substantially I decided to start keeping a blog. Posts will include current multimedia works I'm creating, as well as my thoughts on the current state and direction of multimedia art.
